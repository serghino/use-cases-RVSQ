To create each request with a UC01 specification and a PlantUML diagram, follow this workflow:

Specification Document

Create a Markdown file named UC01_Specification.md.
In this file, describe the use case (UC01) in detail:
Title and ID (e.g., UC01: RÃ©server un RDV)
Actors involved
Preconditions
Main scenario (step-by-step)
Alternative scenarios
Postconditions
PlantUML Diagram

Create a PlantUML file named UC01_Reserver_RDV.puml.
In this file, use PlantUML syntax to visually represent the use case:
Actors and system boundaries
Interactions (arrows for steps)
Optionally, include notes for alternative flows
